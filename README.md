Same thing as the original, just more functionality and no hashing (even though it wasnt really hashing tbh)


I overused IF statements, so don't criticize me for that. Future projects of mine will hopefully be written in Swift, and C++.

TBH most likely Swift since I plan to make some apps in the near future.
